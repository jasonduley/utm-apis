      The set of scopes used in UTM OAuth 2.0 implementation. Scopes take the
      form of <namespace>_<operation>.<object> where "operation" is the type of
      permission (read/write, etc.) and "object" is the type of thing the action
      is performed upon. A "write" action should be assumed to all read access
      to the subject as well as writing. The namespace may aid in deconfliction
      and clarity of scopes. Terms conform to INCITS 359.

  severity:
    description: >-
      The severity level of a UTMMessage. This severity labeling may be used by
      other components within UTM as well.  The labels are ordered such that
      they may be given priority handling by software systems and human users.
      **EMERGENCY > ALERT > CRITICAL > WARNING > NOTICE > INFORMATIONAL**
      In relation to a UTMMessage, the severities may be interpreted as follows.
      1. **EMERGENCY**
        There is an *immediate* impact to the safety of other air operations, the safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground. Actions to mitigate required by other operations.
      2. **ALERT**
        There may be an impact to the safety of other air operations, the safety of people, or the safety of structures on the ground. Actions to mitigate required by other operations.
      3. **CRITICAL**
        Without mitigations by the affected operation, the situation may rise to an emergency in the near future.
      4. **WARNING**
        There is a contained issue that may result in the loss of aircraft. No immediate or likely effect to other operations, people on the ground, or structures.
      5. **NOTICE**
        This issue is provided for situational awareness. Planning by operators and USSs may be affected.
      6. **INFORMATIONAL**
        This issue is provided for situational awareness.
      Note that this approach leverages RFC 5424: "The Syslog Protocol." By
      taking this approach, there is the possibility of formalizing UTMMessaging
      with more elements of the RFC to allow for compatibility with other
      logging systems.

          The current state of the operation.  Must be maintained by the USS.
          Some additional details in the USS Specification.
          1. ACCEPTED
            This operation has been deemed ACCEPTED by the supporting USS. This implies that the operation meets the requirements for operating in the airspace based on the type of operation submitted.
          2. ACTIVATED
            This operation is active. The transition from ACCEPTED to ACTIVATED is not an announced transition. The transition is implied based on the submitted start time of the operation (i.e. the effective_time_begin of the first OperationVolume). Note that an ACTIVATED operation is not necessarily airborne, but is assumed to be "using" the OperationVolumes that it has announced.
          3. CLOSED
            This operation is closed. It is not airborne and will not become airborne again. If the UAS and the crew will fly again, it would need to be as a new operation. A USS may announce the closure of any operation, but is not required to announce unless the operation was ROGUE or NONCONFORMING.
          4. NONCONFORMING
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.
          5. ROGUE
            See USS Specification for requirements to transition to this state.

          3. PART_101E

            1. LOST_C2_UPLINK
              The operation has lost command or control uplink to the vehicle.
            2. LOST_C2_DOWNLINK
              The operation has lost downlinks from the vehicle.

              The vehicle no longer has sufficient navigation sources.
            4. LOST_SAA
              The vehicle's sense and avoid solution is no longer reliable.
            5. LOW_FUEL
              The vehicle does not have enough power to complete its mission. Still enough fuel to safely land or potentially return to base.
            6. NO_FUEL
              The vehicle is either completely without fuel or has only enough fuel to land immediately.
            7. MECHANICAL_PROBLEM
              The vehicle is experiencing a mechanical problem necessitating initiation of a contingency response.
            8. SOFTWARE_PROBLEM
              The vehicle or some component of the required platform ground equipment is experiencing a software problem.
            9. ENVIRONMENTAL
              There are conditions in the environment necessitating initiation of a contingency response. Generally these will be weather-related phenomena.
            10. SECURITY
              There is a security incident interrupting this operation.
            11. TRAFFIC
              The density or type of air traffic near the vehicle necessitated a contingency response.
            12. LOST_USS
              The operation has lost at least some portion of expected USS services.
            13. OTHER
              Some cause not captured in any other category.
            14. ANY

            The operation will be landing by targeting the contingency_point.

          3. RETURN_TO_BASE
            The operation will return to base as specified by the contingency_point. The USS may issue an update to the operation plan to support this maneuver.

          landing sites with all other factors being held equal, though dynamic
          conditions will likely play a role in adjusting this ranking in real

          would be less preferred than it might be otherwise. Further

          1. UNPLANNED_LANDING
            This operation had to land earlier than expected and/or at a location other than was originally planned. Must be sent with severity CRITICAL unless there is any damage other than to the UAS.
          2. UNCONTROLLED_LANDING
            This operation had an uncontrolled landing either at the originally planned landing location or another location. Must be sent with severity CRITICAL unless there is any damage other than to the UAS.
          3. OPERATION_NONCONFORMING
            This operation has entered the NONCONFORMING state. Must be sent to LUN anytime operation transitions to this state. Must be sent with severity ALERT if the operation is expected to intersect another operation plan or unauthorized airspace.  Must be sent with severity EMERGENCY if already intersecting another operation or if already entered unauthorized airspace. Otherwise, must be sent with severity CRITICAL.
          4. OPERATION_ROGUE
            This operation has entered the ROGUE state. Must be sent to LUN anytime operation transitions to ROGUE state. Must be sent with severity ALERT if no current or immediate intersection with another operation or unauthorized airspace. Must be sent with severity EMERGENCY is known to intersect with existing operation or unauthorized airspace.
          5. OPERATION_CONFORMING
            This operation was previously in the NONCONFORMING state and has transitioned back to the ACTIVE state. 'gufi' field is required with this message_type.
          6. OPERATION_CLOSED
            This operation has entered the terminal CLOSED state. The operation will not again be active or in flight. This message is not required if the operation is transitioned to the CLOSED state from the ACTIVE state, but may be provided at the USS's discretion. This message is required when the operation transitioned from any state other than the ACTIVE state to the CLOSED state. If transitioning an operation from ACCEPTED to CLOSED, this message must have a severity of NOTICE. If transitioning from NONCONFORMING or ROGUE, this message must have a severity of CRITICAL.
          7. CONTINGENCY_PLAN_INITIATED
            Description TBD.
          8. CONTINGENCY_PLAN_CANCELLED
            Description TBD.
          9. PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_START
            The requestor wants position reports provided for the operation referenced in the 'gufi' field of this request. Reports MUST be provided as per the USS Specification. Must be sent with severity NOTICE.
          10. PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_END
            The requestor wants previously requested position reports to end. If this message is received without a corresponding PERIODIC_POSITION_REPORTS_START, the message response is TBD (200, 400, 401, 404, etc.). Must be sent with severity NOTICE.
          11. UNAUTHORIZED_AIRSPACE_PROXIMITY
            An operation is within 3038 feet (almost 0.5nmi) from the boundary of unauthorized airspace (e.g., Dynamic Restriction/TFR, controlled airspace, airspace constraint)
          12. UNAUTHORIZED_AIRSPACE_ENTRY
            An operation has breached the boundary and entered into unauthorized airspace (e.g., Dynamic Restriction/TFR, controlled airspace, airspace constraint)
          13. OTHER_SEE_FREE_TEXT
