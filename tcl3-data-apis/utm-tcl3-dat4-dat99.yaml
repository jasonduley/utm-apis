  DAT4:
    description: >- 
      DAT4 MOP collects metrics and data related to the UAS ID concept demo.  This includes the technology used to identify the vehicle and HTTP request/response data resulting from the communication with the corresponding public safety USS.  Further details are discused below.

  DAT99:
    description: >-
      DAT 99 MOP records the various timestamps associated with the registration of a USS instance with the USS Discovery Service.  In order to register a USS instance, a sequence of HTTP requests (PUT) and HTTP responses occur.  For a given instance, we record the timestamps of these events.  A USS instance can have one and only one data object (instance_reg_latency) described below.
